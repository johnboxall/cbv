Hey Djangonauts,

I'm excited to share how we've been using class based views
 at Mobify!

I'll give a brief introduction to class based views (CBV),
showing how to convert simple list, detail and form views
to use CBV. From there we'll go all in covering mixins,
debugging, common pitfalls and patterns we've found
successful.

Please let me know if there is anything related to CBVs
you'd like me to specifically cover.

Cheers,

John
